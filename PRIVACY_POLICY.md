# Privacy Policy for Simple Phone

**Effective Date:** December 13, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how Simple Phone ("we", "us", or "our") handles your information when you use our mobile application (the "App").

## 1. Data Collection and Usage

**We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.**

Simple Phone is designed to be a completely offline and private application. It functions solely on your device and does not communicate with any external servers.

*   **Contacts:** The App accesses your device's contacts solely to display them within the App and to facilitate making phone calls. This data remains on your device and is never shared with us or any third parties.
*   **Call Log:** The App accesses your call log to display recent calls and missed calls. This data remains on your device.
*   **Phone State:** The App accesses phone state to detect incoming calls and ongoing calls to provide the in-call interface.

## 2. Internet Access

The App does not request or use the Internet permission (`android.permission.INTERNET`). It is technically impossible for the App to send data to the internet.

## 3. Permissions

The App requests the following permissions to function as a phone dialer:

*   **Read/Write Contacts:** To display and manage your contacts.
*   **Call Phone:** To initiate phone calls.
*   **Read Call Log:** To display your call history.
*   **Read Phone State:** To handle incoming and outgoing calls.
*   **Default Dialer:** To function as your primary phone application.

## 4. Children's Privacy

Our App is safe for children and people of all ages. We do not knowingly collect personal identifiable information from anyone, including children under 13. Since the app operates entirely offline, no data is transmitted to us or any third parties.

## 5. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes.
